# Better Safe Than Sorry

Custom backups made easy.

## About Better Safe Than Sorry

I have quite some Linux systems at home which contain various types of data ranging from normal files, git (and some old svn) repositories, databases to the git-annex repository which I use to store my full archive. Some of this data is quite important for me, so a reliable backup strategy is imperative.

I started with a simple shell script copying important files to external USB drives a long time ago (in 2014, according to my git history). Over time, I collected a large number of shell functions for all different types of data and a lot of code to call the right functions for every possible backup. And functions to verify backups of course, since a corrupted backup is even more frustrating than no backup at all.

To make things a bit easier to maintain, I started writing Better Safe Than Sorry. The main goal is to create a library of my backup functions, a system to configure all my backups and a way to run the backups, either manually (for backups from and to mobile devices) or automatic (from and to remote systems).

## Installation

## Getting Started

To decrease my electricity consumption, I recently bought a mini server (wormwood) to run some applications that previously ran on my desktop PC (calvin) so that I can just shut down my desktop PC when I'm not using it. This system currently runs my maarten@home website with some webapps (and some other services, but let's keep the example small) in Docker containers and is the perfect example to show how Better Safe Than Sorry works.

The most important data on this system are of course the data (database and media files) of my maarten@home website (and the data of the other services). The website itself and the deployment scripts of the website and other services are stored in Git repositories, so no additional data backups are needed. To reduce the recovery time in case the the SSD or the full system would fail, I want to make a full system backup now and then, but this takes a lot more time and no data is lost if this backup is a bit outdated, so I split the data and system backups.

These requirements yield this configuration file `~/.config/bettersafethansorry/config.yaml` for Better Safe Than Sorry:

```yaml

        keep: 3

      - description: Archive maarten@home django database
        action: ArchivePostgreSQL
        source-host: maarten@wormwood.home.vijfendertig.be
        source-container: maartenathome-maartenathome-postgres-1
        source-database: maartenathome@maartenathome
        destination-file: /srv/backup/hosts/wormwood/data/maartenathome-database.sql.bz2

        source-container: django@maartenathome-maartenathome-django-1
        source-directory: /srv/django/media/
        destination-file: /srv/backup/hosts/wormwood/data/maartenathome-media.tar.bz2
        destination-compression: bzip2
        keep: 3
loggers:
  - logger: File
    filename: /home/maarten/.local/log/bettersafethansorry.log
    append: true
```

The configuration file defines three backups:

- `wormwood-image` makes a full filesystem backup, split in one `.tar.bz2` archive for each filesystem (`/`, `/boot` and `/boot/efi`). The backups are made to my desktop PC and because I have a decent LAN at home and the CPU of my desktop PC is much more performant than the CPU of the mini server, I send the backups as (uncompressed) tar files to my desktop PC and bzip2 them there.
- `wormwood-maartenathome` makes a backup of the Django database in the maarten@home PostgreSQL container and the data directory in the maarten@home Django container. The backups are made to whatever system runs the backup (the data is important and the backup is not that big, so I sometimes just backup to my laptop if my desktop is off). Again, compression is done on the system running the backup.

Logs are stored in a simple text file `~/.local/log/bettersafethansorry.log` and subsequent invocations just add their logs to the file.

`bsts list` lists the available backups and `bsts do wormwood-image` and `bsts do wormwood-maartenathome` run the individual backups.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Usage: `bsts [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-n] command [backup]`

Positional arguments:

- `command`: `list`, `status`, `show` or `do`
- `backup`: backup to show or perform (as defined in the configuration file)

Options:

- `-h` or `--help`: show this help message and exit
- `-c CONFIG` or `--config CONFIG`: select configuration file
- `-a` or `--auto`: only perform the backup if it is outdated
- `-n` or `--dry-run`: do not actually perform actions, only log them

### Configuration file

- [X] ~~Backup Subversion repositories~~ (not needed, archive directories instead)

Backup configuration:

- [X] Actions

- [X] Includes and templates
- [X] Variable substitution

Backup operation:

- [X] Command line interface (CLI)
- [X] Store timestamps
- [X] Run outdated backups automatically
- [X] Warn for outdated backups
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Continuous logging (instead of buffering until the subprocesses finish)
